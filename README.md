# How to use this Repo
we dont actually reccomend using the **Github Full Repository**. unless you want everything. github downloads **ENTIRE** Reposotorys as Zip files (unless you download a file one by one which can be a pain since you cant download specific folders). so unless you want every file (which could end up being alot) We reccomend using our [site](...) and selecting what you want to download
